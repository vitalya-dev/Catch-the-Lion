# Sure, here‚Äôs a basic roadmap for your D≈çbutsu sh≈çgi game project in Godot:


1. Design the Game Structure: Plan out the structure of your game, including the nodes and their hierarchy. You can refer to the structure I provided earlier. [Done]

2. Create the Game Board: Start by creating the game board. You can use a GridMap node for this. [Done]

3. Create the Game Pieces: Next, create the game pieces. Each piece should be a RigidBody with a MeshInstance for graphics and a CollisionShape for detecting clicks or touches. [Done]

4. Implement Piece Movement: Implement the logic for moving the pieces according to the rules of D≈çbutsu sh≈çgi. [ ]
	1. Define Piece Movements: Each piece in D≈çbutsu sh≈çgi has its own unique movement. Start by defining these movements. For example, the chick can only move forward, the elephant can move diagonally, and so on. [Done]

	2. Create Movement Functions: Write functions for each type of movement. These functions should take a piece and a destination as input, and move the piece to the destination if the move is legal. [Done]

	3. Check for Legal Moves: Before a piece is moved, check if the move is legal. This involves checking if the destination is within the board and if the piece is allowed to move in that manner. [Done]

	4. Handle Piece Capture: If a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent‚Äôs piece, that piece is captured and removed from the board. Implement this rule in your movement functions.

	5. Implement Promotion: In D≈çbutsu sh≈çgi, a chick is promoted to a hen when it moves to the farthest row. The hen can move one square in any direction. Implement this rule in your game.

	6. Link Movements to User Input: Finally, link your movement functions to user input. When a player clicks or taps on a piece and then on a destination square, the game should move the piece accordingly.

5. Implement Game Logic: Implement the game logic, including turn handling and win/loss conditions. [ ]

6. Implement AI: Implement an AI opponent for single-player games. You can use a minimax algorithm for this, as I described earlier. [ ]

7. Test Your Game: Playtest your game regularly to find and fix bugs, and to make sure the game is fun to play. [ ]

8. Polish Your Game: Add finishing touches like sound effects, animations, and UI elements to polish your game. [ ]

9. Publish Your Game: Once you‚Äôre happy with your game, publish it so others can play it! [ ]

Remember that making a game is a big project and can take some time, so don‚Äôt get discouraged if things don‚Äôt work right away. Keep experimenting, learning, and having fun with it! Good luck! üòä
