Sure, we can merge steps 7 and 8. Here's the updated roadmap:

1. Design the Game Structure: Plan out the structure of your game, including the nodes and their hierarchy. [Done]
2. Create the Game Board: Start by creating the game board. [Done]
3. Create the Game Pieces: Next, create the game pieces. [Done]
4. Implement Piece Movement: Implement the logic for moving the pieces according to the rules of D≈çbutsu sh≈çgi. [Done]
5. Implement Game Logic: Implement the game logic, including win/loss conditions and turn handling. [Done]
6. Implement Basic AI: Implement an AI opponent for single-player games.[Done]
7. Improve AI: Enhance the AI's decision-making process to make it more challenging. This could involve implementing a more sophisticated algorithm, such as Minimax or Alpha-Beta pruning, teaching the AI to learn from its mistakes using machine learning techniques, and modifying the AI logic to occasionally select a piece from the captured area and place it back on the board.
8. Test Your Game: Playtest your game regularly to find and fix bugs, and to make sure the game is fun to play.
9. Polish Your Game: Add finishing touches like sound effects, animations, and UI elements to polish your game.
10. Publish Your Game: Once you‚Äôre happy with your game, publish it so others can play it!

Now, "Improve AI" is step 7 in your game development process and includes enhancing decision-making, learning from mistakes, and selecting pieces from the captured area. Good luck! üòä
