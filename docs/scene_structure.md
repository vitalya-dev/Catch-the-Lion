- Main Scene (Spatial): This is the root node of your game.
	- Camera (Camera3D): This node represents the camera view. You can adjust its properties to get the desired perspective, angle and depth of field.
	- DirectionalLight3D (DirectionalLight3D): This node provides directional light to the scene.
	- Board (MeshInstance): This node represents the game board. You might use a GridMap for this.
		- Pieces (Spatial): This node is a parent to all the game pieces.
			- Chick (Area3D): This node represents a chick piece. It should have a MeshInstance child for graphics and a CollisionShape child for detecting 	clicks or touches.
			- Hen (Area3D): This node represents a hen piece, which is a promoted chick. It should also have MeshInstance and CollisionShape children.
			- Elephant (Area3D): This node represents an elephant piece. It should also have MeshInstance and CollisionShape children.
			- Lion (Area3D): This node represents a lion piece. It should also have MeshInstance and CollisionShape children.
			- Giraffe (Area3D): This node represents a giraffe piece. It should also have MeshInstance and CollisionShape children.
		- GameController (Node): This node controls the game logic, like checking for valid moves, handling turns, and determining win or loss conditions.

Remember that this is just a basic structure. Depending on your gameâ€™s requirements, you might need to add more nodes or adjust this structure. For example, you might want to add nodes for the UI or sound effects. Good luck with your project! ðŸ˜Š
